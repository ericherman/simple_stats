	Begin the 2.0 development.

	The goal of 2.0 is to be able to more easily use
	simple_stats in embedded firmwares directly, without needing
	to modify the sources.

	The "from file" and "to string" functions have been moved
	out of the main simple_stats.h and simple_stats.c have moved
	to the simple_stats_report.h and simple_stats_report.c so
	because these functions rely on libc FILE and printf.

	Rather than link directly to sqrt() as provided by <math.h>,
	the function pointer (*simple_stats_sqrt) is used. By
	default, this is set to sqrt. In the non-HOSTED case, this
	pointer is initialized to a less efficient -- but hopefully
	reasonable enough -- implementation.

	Functions and structs have had their prefixes normalized.

	The typedef of the structs has been dropped, callers are
	free to do this themselves if they wish.

	* src/simple_stats.h: move HOSTED prototypes to simple_stats_report.h
	* src/simple_stats.c: move FILE functions to simple_stats_report.c
	* src/simple_stats_report.h: to_string and from_file
	* src/simple_stats_report.c: to_string and from_file
	* src/simple_stats_options.h: clean-up the options struct
	* src/simple_stats_options.c: follow new struct/API
	* src/simple_stats_cli_main.c: use new options API
	* src/ss_options.h: rename to src/simple_stats_options.h
	* src/ss_options.c: rename to src/simple_stats_options.c
	* src/main.c: renamed to src/simple_stats_cli_main.c
	* tests/test-sstats-basic.c: use simple_stats_report, test sqrt
	* Makefile: adjust for filenames

	Allow specifying Bessel's Correction to variance and std-dev.
	Make the to_string function easier to use in a printf.
	Add a runnable test-case and a "make check" target.

	* src/simple_stats.h: allow specifying bessel-correction or not
		for variance and std-dev
		to_string: return the char *, out-param for bytes written
	* src/simple_stats.c: add bessel-correction, fix calculation
	* src/main.c: add NULL written param for to_string call
	* tests/test-sstats-basic.c: add test with-and-without bessel
	* tests/echeck.h: copied from E(asy)Check
	* tests/echeck.c: https://github.com/ericherman/libecheck
	* misc/pre-tidy.patch: re-spin for header change
	* Makefile: make check target
	* .gitignore: ignore test
